# Linear Regression

This repository demonstrates how to implement Linear Regression from scratch in Python using **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**, along with comparisons to **scikit-learn**'s implementation.

It covers:

- Linear Regression using **Gradient Descent**
- Linear Regression using the **Closed-Form Solution (Normal Equation)** â€” _(planned)_
- Visualization of training performance via **MSE vs Iterations**
- Comparison with **Scikit-learn's LinearRegression**
